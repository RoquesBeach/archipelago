[Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) provides a serverless execution environment that allows you to
create entirely new applications or augment existing ones without configuring or maintaining infrastructure.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

> verify installation: `node -v`

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

> verify installation: `git -v`

- [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) -> `npm install -g lerna`

> verify installation: `lerna -v`

## First Steps

You can [sign up at Cloudflare Workers](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers) with your own account for
free and experiment with the sample code in the
[Playground](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/playground). Using the admin side of your Cloudflare
Workers account will be the easiest way to deploy Workers without using the
[Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler).

## Getting started

- `npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler`

- `wrangler --version`

## Creating a new worker

```shell
cd packages
wrangler generate my-worker
cd my-worker
```

Since we are building all the Workers under one account and subdomain `roquesbeach.workers.dev` you must fill out your
[wrangler.toml](packages/john/wrangler.toml) with

```toml
account_id = "9ce3889ba6eb93d1a68f191e1ac67c01"
```

Then to test the Worker locally run

```shell
wrangler dev
```

## Coding

[Examples](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples)

[Tutorials](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tutorials)

The starter point of the Worker is **index.js** but Cloudflare Workers also 
[supports other languages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/languages).

For this project we are using JavaScript only since we are managing the project with Lerna.

## Deployment

We use Lerna locally to publish all the Workers at once, so you need to update your `package.json` with entries for
`build` and `publish`, but these entries are not needed for publishing a single worker. 

From the repository root run

```shell
lerna run publish
```

To deploy a single Worker `cd` to its directory and run

```shell
wrangler publish
```

We use a GitHub Action to deploy on merge to main branch but each Worker deployment is separate. 

So you will also need to update the workflow [**wrangler.yml**](.github/workflows/wrangler.yml) and add another entry
for your Worker, take the example of [packages/john/package.json](packages/john/package.json).

Example **.github/workflows/wrangler.yml**

```yaml
my-worker:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  name: üßò my-worker
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: üöÄ Publish
      uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.3.0
      with:
        apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
        workingDirectory: "packages/my-worker"
```

Using this example you can change all strings `my-worker` for your Worker name (you need to add it at **jobs:** scope).
