Cloudflare Workers provides a serverless execution environment that allows you to create entirely new applications
or augment existing ones without configuring or maintaining infrastructure.

## Requirements

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

> verify installation: `node -v`

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

> verify installation: `git -v`

- [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) -> `npm install -g lerna`

> verify installation: `lerna -v`

- [Sign up at Cloudflare Workers](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers)

## Getting started

- `npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler`

- `wrangler --version`

## Creating a new worker

```shell
cd packages
wrangler generate my-worker
cd my-worker
```

Since we are building all the Workers under one account and subdomain you must fill out your [wrangler.toml](packages/john/wrangler.toml) with

```toml
account_id = "9ce3889ba6eb93d1a68f191e1ac67c01"
```

Then to test the Worker locally run

```shell
wrangler dev
```

## Coding

[Examples](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples)

[Tutorials](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tutorials)

The starter point of the Worker is **index.js** but Cloudflare Workers also 
[supports other languages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/languages)

For this project was are using JavaScript only since we are managing the project with Lerna.

## Deployment

We use Lerna locally and publish all workers at once, so you need to update your `package.json` with entries for "build"
and "publish", but these entries are not needed for publishing a single worker. 

From the repository root run

```shell
lerna run publish
```

To deploy a single Worker `cd` to its directory and run

```shell
wrangler publish
```

![wrangler publish](images/wrangler-publish.png)

We use a GitHub Action to deploy on merge to main branch but each worker deployment is separate. 

So you will also need to update the workflow **wrangler.yml** and add another entry for your worker, take the example
of `john/package.json`.

Example **.github/workflows/wrangler.yml**

```yaml
my-worker:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  name: 🧘 my-worker
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: 🚀 Publish
      uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.3.0
      with:
        apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
        workingDirectory: "packages/my-worker"
```

Using this example you can change all strings 'my-worker' for your worker name (you need to add it at **jobs:** scope).
